            </h2>
            <p class="lead">India is the country which gives the largest number of cinemas to the world entertainment industry. With the fast-growing Indian economy and advancement of globalization, Indian Cinema is becoming increasingly popular in various countries around the world. More and more people around the world irrespective of their ethnicity watch and follow Bollywood movies. Indian Cinema and its culture are vital aspects of South Asian programs, and there has been a growing interest in the scholarly study of Bollywood and Indian Cinema among the South Asian diaspora. In recent years movies produced in India have received international attention and appreciation. At present limited resources are available as digital sources or over the internet which can cater to business, academia or research areas on Indian Cinema. Most of this information pertains to new movies. Old undocumented movies are lost in the dark. Available dataset over the internet only concentrate on blockbusters, which are by no means exhaustive. There is a major dearth of digital sources of information on Indian Cinema. </p>

Along with this, we would plan to make the review entry system much easier. Just speak about the movie and we got it!
