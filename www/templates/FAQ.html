						Of course, you can use IMIS as a guest access where the user can still be able to browse for the movies and get the needed information. But, however there are certain benefits that are limited to guest users. If a user creates account, we can track the user and reward him with free tickets or so if he gets selected in our lucky pick up scheme. Besides this, guest users would not have access to developer APIs. Hence, its recommended that you subscribe for IMIS!
